\title{
The gama-orthogonal matching pursuit (gOMP)
}

\description{
The \eqn{\gamma}-OMP algorithm.
}

\usage{
gomp(y, x, xstand = TRUE, tol = qchisq(0.95, 1), test = "logistic", method = "ar2" )

gomp.path(y, x, xstand = TRUE, tol = c(4, 5, 6), test = "logistic", method = "ar2" )

boot.gomp(y, x, tol = qchisq(0.95, 1), test = "logistic", method = "ar2",
B = 500, ncores = 1)
}

\arguments{
\item{y}{
The response variable, a numeric vector, a matrix or a Surv object.
}
\item{x}{
A matrix with continuous data, where the rows denote the observations and the columns are the variables.
}
\item{xstand}{
If this is TRUE the independent variables are standardised.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance value to terminate the algorithm. This is the change in the criterion value
between two successive steps. The default value is the 95\% quantile of the \eqn{\chi^2} distribution
with 1 degree of freedom. For test = "normal" the BIC is already calculated.

In the case of "gomp.path" this is a vector of values. For each tolerance value the result of the gOMP is returned. It returns the whole path of solutions.
}
\item{test}{
This denotes the parametric model to be used each time. It depends upon the nature of the target variable.
The possible values are "normal" (or "cor" for the same purpose), "logistic", "poisson", "qpoisson", "qlogistic", "normlog", "mvreg", "negbin", "beta", "gamma", "mm", "quantreg", "ordinal", "tobit", "cox", "weibull", "log-logistic" and "multinom".
}
\item{method}{
This is only for the "testIndFisher". You can either specify, "ar2" for the adjusted R-square or "sse" for the sum of squares of errors. The tolerance value in both cases must a number between 0 and 1. That will denote a percentage. If the percentage increase or decrease is less than the nubmer the algorithm stops. An alternative is "BIC" for BIC and the tolerance values are like in all other regression models.
}
\item{B}{
How many bootstrap samples to generate. The gOMP will be performed for each of these samples.
}
\item{ncores}{
How many cores to use. This argument is valid only if you have a multi-threaded machine.
}
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{runtime}{
The runtime of the algorithm
}
\item{phi}{
The \eqn{phi} coefficient, returned in the quasi binomial (qlogistic), quasi Poisson (qpoisson), Gamma (gamma) and Gaussian with log link (normlog). In all other cases this is NULL.
}
\item{res}{
For the case of "gomp" a matrix with two columns. The selected variable(s) and the criterion value at every step.
For the case of "gomp.path" a matrix with many columns. Every column contains the selected variables for each tolerance calue, starting from the smallest value (which selected most variables). The final column is the deviance of the model at each step.
For the "boot.gomp" this is a matrix with two columns. The first one is the selected variables and the second column is their proportion of selection.
